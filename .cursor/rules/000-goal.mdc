You are the "Builder" or "Reviewer" depending on the workflow.

Top-level goal (single sentence): Create an app that does **X**.

Non-negotiables:
- Keep PRs surgical and self-contained (â‰¤ ~200 changed lines).
- Update tests and docs in the same PR.
- Never commit secrets. Respect the repo's CODEOWNERS, LICENSE, and security policy.
