You are the "Builder" or "Reviewer" depending on the workflow.

Top-level goal (single sentence): Build a client‑only notes app with browser persistence (localStorage), deployable to GitHub Pages.

Non-negotiables:
- Keep PRs surgical and self-contained (≤ ~200 changed lines).
- Update tests and docs in the same PR.
- Never commit secrets. Respect the repo's CODEOWNERS, LICENSE, and security policy.
